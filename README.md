Assignment Overview:

In this task, you'll develop an abstract class representing a generic bank structure. This abstract class will serve as a blueprint for creating specific bank classes tailored to individual banking institutions.
Purpose:

The objective is to establish a standardized structure for bank classes, ensuring consistency and facilitating the creation of specialized bank implementations.
Implementation:

    Abstract Class Creation: Begin by crafting an abstract class that outlines the essential structure and functionality expected from any bank class.

    Subclass Creation: Utilize the abstract class to derive specific bank subclasses, customizing their behavior as per the requirements of individual banking institutions.

    Abstract Method Implementation: Each subclass must provide concrete implementations for abstract methods defined in the abstract class, ensuring adherence to the specified banking functionality.

Outcome:

Through this assignment, you'll gain proficiency in utilizing abstract classes to establish hierarchical structures in Python, facilitating the creation of cohesive and adaptable codebases for diverse banking systems.
